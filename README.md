**CYBER SECURITY INTERNSHIP
Task 3: Networking Basics for Cyber Security
Name: Yaswanth Vajja
Organization: Elevate Labs
Internship: Cyber Security Internship
Date: January 2026**
1. Introduction to Networking for Cyber Security
Networking enables communication between devices and systems. Understanding networking
concepts is essential in cyber security to monitor, analyze, and protect data transmissions.
2. Basic Networking Concepts
IP addresses identify devices on a network, while MAC addresses identify hardware interfaces.
DNS converts domain names into IP addresses. TCP and UDP are transport layer protocols used
for data transfer.
3. Packet Capturing and Analysis
Packet capturing involves collecting network packets for analysis. Wireshark is commonly used to
inspect traffic and detect suspicious activity.
4. TCP Three-Way Handshake
The TCP three-way handshake establishes a reliable connection using SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK
packets before data transmission begins.
5. Plain-text vs Encrypted Traffic
Plain-text traffic such as HTTP is unencrypted and vulnerable to interception, whereas HTTPS
encrypts data to ensure confidentiality and security.
6. DNS Traffic Analysis
DNS traffic analysis helps identify malicious domains, phishing attempts, and abnormal network
behavior by examining DNS queries and responses.
7. Network Traffic Observations
Analyzing captured packets provides insight into communication patterns and helps detect
anomalies and potential security threats.
8. Conclusion
This task strengthened the understanding of networking fundamentals required for cyber security
and network traffic analysis.
